You can easily connect your Anki notes together by this add-on, forming a web of interconnected information. 
By establishing links between relevant notes, you can create a comprehensive and organized knowledge base that reflects the relationships between various concepts, ideas, and topics.

## Link Format

`[Link Title|nidxxxxxxxxxxxxx]`

The link title is the content displayed in the card. If the title contains`[`, it needs to be escaped with`\[`

`x` is the ID of the note, consisting of 13 digits

## Usage

### In the editor:

#### Copy note ID

Copy the ID of the current note in the editor by using the right-click menu or pressing `Alt+Shift+C`

#### Copy note link

Copy the link of the current note in the editor by using the right-click menu or pressing `Alt+Shift+L`

#### Insert link with copied note ID

Generate a link from the note ID in the clipboard and the currently selected text by either using the right-click menu or pressing `Alt+Shift+V`

#### Insert new link

Generate a new link from the currently selected text by either using the right-click menu or pressing `Alt+Shift+N`

Double-clicking the generated link allows adding a corresponding new note

#### Insert link template

Generate a link template from the currently selected text by either using the right-click menu or pressing `Alt+Shift+T`

The generated link template looks like this: `[selected text|nid]`, you need to manually complete it

_Note: If no text is selected, using the above actions will generate a link without a title_

#### Open current note in new window

Open current note in new window by using the right-click menu or pressing `Alt+Shift+W`

#### Open the note corresponding to the link

`Double click` link to open the corresponding note in a new window

### In the links panel / graph panel:

`Left click` to open the corresponding note in the current window

`Right click` to open the corresponding note in a new window

`Middle click` to open the corresponding note in the browser (unsupported in graph view)

### In the previewer / reviewer / global graph:

`Left click` to open the corresponding note in an editor window

`Right click` to open the corresponding note in a previewer window

### Global relationship graph (Experimental)

Entrance: `Menu -> Anki Note Linker -> Global Relationship Graph (Experimental)`

Please set the video driver in Anki preference to an option other than `Software`, as it can significantly decrease graphic performance

### Customize shortcut keys

You can customize the shortcut keys according to your preferences in add-on configuration

If there is no response when using the shortcut key, it may be due to a shortcut key conflict. Please try changing the shortcut key

## How to display notes properly without this add-on (like AnkiDroid)

This add-on automatically renders note links as corresponding content. However, without the add-on, the links will not be rendered, such as in AnkiDroid.

If you have generated note links and need to use them without the add-on, you can add the following code to your card template. It will automatically render the correct note content even without this add-on.

```html
<script>
    requestIdleCallback(() => {
        try { AnkiNoteLinkerIsActive } catch (e) {
            document.documentElement.innerHTML = document.documentElement.innerHTML
                .replace(/\[((?:[^\[]|\\\[)*?)\|nid\d{13}\]/g, (match, title) => title.replace(/\\\[/g, '['))
        }
    })
</script>
```


If you are using it on the AnkiMobile (iOS) platform, the above code may not render the note content correctly. In this case you will need to add the following code to the card template. Note that `{{Back}}` can be replaced with a field where you have included a note links generated by this addon.

```html
<div id="back";>{{Back}}</div>

<script>
var contentDiv = document.getElementById('back');
var onlyContent = document.getElementById('back').innerHTML;
var regex = /\[(.*?)\|nid\d{13}\]/g;
var matches = onlyContent.match(regex);
if (matches) {
    var replacedContent = onlyContent.replace(/\[((?:[^\[]|\\\[)*?)\|nid\d{13}\]/g, function(match, group) {
        return group;
    });
    contentDiv.innerHTML = replacedContent;
}
</script>
```
